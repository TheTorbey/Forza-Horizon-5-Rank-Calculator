## About the Prestige System
> Prestige is first awarded once you've earned enough Global Influence to reach Rank 200. 
>
> Throughout Forza Horizon 5, players with Prestige levels are identified by a numbered star next to their Gamertag. When you Prestige, you will revert to Rank 1, and your new Prestige star distinguishes your experience. This is visible to all other players.
